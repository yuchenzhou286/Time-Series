In this case study, I analyzed and used historical oil production data, from 1992 to 2018, for a country to forecast its future production. I built a time series forecasting model using the AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA models to forecast oil production.


The dataset that I will be using is 'Crude Oil Production by Country'. This dataset contains the yearly oil production of 222 countries, but for simplicity, I will forecast only one country's future oil production.


I tried  several different modeling techniques on this time series:
- AR (p)
- MA (q)
- ARMA (p, q)
- ARIMA (p, d, q)

and then checked which one performs better.
